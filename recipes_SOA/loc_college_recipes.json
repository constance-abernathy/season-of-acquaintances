I listen to the lecturer run the length of his knowledge; I listen to the wheedling of chalk against the board. I listen, and I learn.\n#eruditionplus|Today, the college has picked an unusually practiced individual to give the public lecture. The choice of subject is salient, and the rhetoric itself is as clever as it is edifying. The speaker and I exchange thoughts after the hour's end, and my mind comes away bright with new ideas.\n#fact.rational|The current in the air is Newtonian, Euclidian. The higher mathematics and the physical sciences bleed and wash into one another. 'There is an architecture to our world,' the lecturer says, 'and with each passing day we grow closer to understanding its totality.'\n#fact.eccentric|Today is a day of odd intellectual bedfellows. Poetry, philosophy, politics - the lecturer waltzes from the Bard to Bentham, then back again with a clever quip. 'Mark this,' the lecturer says. 'The first thing to understand is that it's all utterly, utterly arbitrary. The rest logically follows as it must.'\n#restlessness|The college's offerings were meagre today. The speaker remained bereft of interest, and lecture's hour felt as a year. Intellectual farce. Unfortunately, I could not even say that it made me laugh.\n@"
