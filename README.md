**A SEASON OF ACQUAINTANCES**

**Mod Outline**

- **Follower Overhaul and Expansion**
  - Twenty-four new followers, three for each aspect minus **Secret Histories**. Each follower will take after an Hour of the pantheon and have a gameplay quirk/side quest association attached to them.
  - Finding and recruiting followers will behave differently. Certain locations in the Capital will have the **Potential Acquaintances** and **Potential Patrons** aspects attached to them, and exploring at these locations with Lore (and Funds, if needed to enter the location) can possibly lead you to encounters with acquaintances and followers. Each location has a set pool of followers to choose from.
    - There is a 30% chance that speaking of lore at a specific location will still fail to produce an encounter, leading either to the location’s regular draw deck or reputation consequences.
    - Each follower/patron will have a unique encounter scenario associated with them, complete with flavour text that reflects the circumstance of meeting them. Rather than the uniform **Reason** or **Passion** you might have had to provide in the base game, an encounter scenario might require you to slot in **Health**, a **Fleeting Reminiscence**, **Fascination**, or anything in between to satisfy, assist, or carry conversation with someone who could be useful to you.
    - Succeeding at a given encounter scenario will produce the encountered follower’s associated **Acquaintance** card, or give you access to the encountered patron.
    - Failing at a given encountered scenario will instead produce a **Whereabouts** card for the encountered individual. If you explore the location with this card (and Funds, if needed to enter the location), you can make another attempt to win them over. 
  - This renders the old technique of talking about lore defunct - slotting lore into Talk will produce a hint describing how wildly unwise that would be.
  - Mechanical tweaks for followers:
    - Followers will go on cooldown for 120 seconds after you use them. 
    - Three scars of any type will kill a follower. 
    - Cult business will depend on the follower, not their aspect. This may necessitate variations on the old cult businesses between followers, or new cult businesses outright.
    - When rebelling, followers will always become Troublemakers, even if they were already Disciples or Exalts beforehand.
- **Hunter Overhaul**
  - Four new hunters to replace Wakefield, Spencer, Connie, and Dr. Dragon. Each hunter will have new mechanical traits that make them more dangerous than the base game hunters.
  - Hunters will also be harder to get rid of, requiring the infliction of three wounds to finally kill them. Followers that usually kill hunters will instead ‘wound’ them, driving said hunter into hiding. They must then be tracked down in order to be attacked again. 
  - 10% chance for a hunter to go into a training recipe that grants them a new trait when they fail to produce evidence against you. 
  - There is a 20% chance that the Weary Detective will be replaced by one of the unique hunters when he fails to produce evidence. 
  - Notoriety, Evidence, and Hunter Activity Expansion
    - Three tiers of evidence: Tentative, Substantial, Damning.
    - New card, Witness
      - Witnesses can be picked up by Hunters to immediately create Substantial evidence.
      - You can murder, bribe, or madden Witnesses in order to get rid of them.
    - New card, Infamy
      - While Infamy is on the board, Hunters will be more aggressive in their search for evidence against you.
      - Infamy cannot be destroyed. 
      - Infamy has a small chance to appear whenever you do something that generates Notoriety.
- **Patron Overhaul**
  - Three new patrons to replace Jannings, Bechet, and Al-Adim. Each patron will have mechanics and requests distinct from the others, and also give different rewards for doing work on their behalf. 
    - William Jericho
    - Rocheford
    - Alexandra Beek?
- **Capital Locations Overhaul and Expansion**
  - All locations in the Capital will have a new slot added to them, which will accept Lore or Whereabouts cards. This slot can be left blank to attend the location as usual.
  - Four new locations in the Capital, which come with their own mechanics, rewards, and follower pool:
    - The Imperial College
    - Church of Our Redeemer Seen
    - East End Bookies 
    - The Tiresiac
  - New jobs at the Imperial College and the Aldgate Bookies; respectively Lecturer and Prize Fighter
- **Opium Dreaming Overhaul**
  - Dreaming with Funds has a chance to create a new ability card, **A Dry Craving**. This card will start with one point of the **Resistance** aspect.

**Hour-Loyalty Aspects**

These will be affixed to followers when they become (Disciples? Exalts? When their side quest is complete?) for some extra flavour. We might have some other mechanical use for them in the future, but as it stands it’s just cool text.

**Follower Roster**

There will be three followers for every aspect, save Secret Histories. Each follower will take after an Hour of the pantheon and have a gameplay quirk and/or side quest association attached to them. There will also be several “universal” traits that multiple followers can have.

**Pacifist** - These followers will be opposed to the unnecessary shedding of blood. Having them present while bypassing Watchers or Monks with Edge, acquiring prisoners, murdering strangers, and attacking detectives may cause Resentment.

**Suspect** - Hunters can sometimes bring these followers in for questioning during a Season of Suspicions. This will usually result in nothing, but it can sometimes produce Mystique or even Notoriety. This will always exhaust the follower. 

**Cannot be Romanced** - This follower cannot be romanced.

**Famous** - Using this follower anywhere can produce reputation cards. However, these followers also produce greater rewards when you paint their portraits, can stall investigators, and 

**Jealous** - While romancing someone else, there is a chance for this follower to gain Resentment. They may try harming your lover if Resentment becomes high enough, or even become a Rival.

**Patron Roster**

The new patrons will each have a unique set of mechanics and rewards attached to them. Patrons left in the game will include Sulochana and Poppy, though Poppy’s commission deck will probably be altered to work cohesively with those of the other patrons.

- William - Academic papers (Lantern, Secret Histories, Heart)
- Poppy - Academic papers (Winter, Knock, Grail)
- Beek - Criminal enterprises (Edge, Forge, Moth)
- H.W. Rocheford - Stories from around the globe (No lore, but need expeditions)


|**Name**|**Notes**|
| :-: | :-: |
|**Professor William Jericho**|<p>**A tenured professor of history at the Imperial College, hiding his own interests in alternate narratives.**</p><p></p><p>William will give commissions that function much the same as base-game ones, asking for pieces on Lantern, Secret Histories, and Heart.</p><p></p><p>Rewards for completing William’s commissions will include spintriae and special Fact cards that can be used to pass research challenges in lieu of the usual headquarters or card requirement.</p>|
|**Alexandra Beek**|<p>**An expatriate crime boss expanding to the Capital following the fracturing of the Duffoure mob in the 1920s.**</p><p></p><p>Beek will give commissions that don’t represent the character doing academic writing for her - rather, she will give ‘contract jobs’ that represent different criminal undertakings. These will include hitjobs (Edge), smuggling (Moth), and counterfeiting (Forge).</p><p></p><p>You will need to provide manpower (a follower) and a relevant technique (lore) for a job to proceed. Rewards will include spintriae and criminal favours, but will also often create reputation consequences for you.</p>|
|**H.M. Rocheford**|<p>**The editor-in-chief for *Interviews with the Invisible*, a monthly news column popular amongst madrugadas and noctambules alike.**</p><p></p><p>Rocheford will ask for stories and interviews from around the world to put in his next issue. Receiving a commission from him will produce a card for **J. Armitage, the Correspondent,** and you will have to take him on an expedition in [specified region depending on what the comm asked for]. Completing the expedition with him in tow will give you the card necessary to complete Rocheford’s expedition.</p><p></p><p>Rewards will include spintriae and [new rewards]</p>|

**New Locations**

New locations in the Capital will provide more depth to the city via new jobs, new mechanics, and being meeting spots for potential followers/patrons. Locations that have a pool of potential followers/patrons available will have the Potential Followers/Potential Patrons aspects attached to them, which will be removed if you draw a Case of Mistaken Identity. 

|**Name**|**Notes**|
| :-: | :-: |
|Imperial College|<p>**A furious congregating point for the new academia of the Capital.**</p><p></p><p>Exploring this location with a Funds will let you attend a lecture there, which can produce useful Ability influences like Erudition and Glimmering. It can also produce Restlessness, in the event the lecture is boring. </p><p></p><p>If you slot William into the Explore verb with this location and a spintriae, he will give you private lessons on occult academics. This will yield a new Comprehension card that will have (10/20/30) of the Complexity aspect attached to it. Putting the Comprehension card into the Study slot with Erudition or Glimmering (different cards will necessitate different requirements) will trigger a recipe that subtracts a random number of Complexity from the Comprehension card. Once it reaches zero, the Comprehension card will become a lore fragment.</p><p></p><p>If you have a scholarship skill, you can apply for an adjunct lecturer job here (this will take you to an interview, which will require no small amount of reason). If you are the Physician, you will have an easier time getting this job. You can win a job retirement victory by following this job chain to its highest stage.</p>|
|Church of Our Redeemer Seen|<p>**A reserved little chapel folded away into the city’s innards, run by a convent of reticent nuns.**</p><p></p><p>Exploring this location will let you attend a mass there, which will draw from a deck of possible rewards. It may also give you nothing. </p><p></p><p>Exploring this location with a Dread, Fascination, or Restlessness grants you a 70% chance to destroy the influence. There is a 30% chance that it will simply give you Restlessness without destroying your initial influence. </p><p><br>If you are the Priest, there will be unique text for visiting this location.</p>|
|East End Bookies|<p>**The fights organized by this betting circuit are strictly off the books. Sometimes they gather in the basement of an Aldgate pub; sometimes the rear room of a suspect casino. Tonight, the crowd throngs here.**</p><p></p><p>Exploring this location with a Fund will let you spectate fights, which will draw from a deck of possible rewards. There is a 20% chance that the authorities will break up the fight, giving Notoriety. </p><p></p><p>If you have the strength skill, you can get the Prize Fighting job here. Winning fights will mutate your job card with the Repute aspect, and passing a certain threshold (15/30) of Repute will make it possible for you to rank up your job (Not instant - keep fighting once you reach the threshold. There is a 50% chance you will be promoted for every fight you do after acquiring the proper amount of Repute). You can achieve a job retirement victory by following this job chain to its highest stage. </p>|
|The Tiresiac|<p>**A retreat spot for those precious few with a gross excess of fortune and reputation. Most of the patrons who frequent this club are - or were - famous.** </p><p></p><p>Exploring this location for the first time will prompt you to purchase a Club Membership card, worth 20 Funds. While this card is on the board, you can frequent the Tiresiac whenever you please (the club will go on a 30 second cooldown thereafter). Be wary - the Club Membership card expires within 200 seconds. You can pay 20 funds at any time to refresh it, but missing a payment will cause it to expire. The cost for restoring it to normal thereafter will be 30 Funds as per lateness fees.</p><p></p><p>Exploring the Tiresiac can let you meet Famous followers, and can also net you some very valuable resources. </p>|
